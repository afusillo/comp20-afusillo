1. The purpose of this Git repository is so I can build up a working portfolio
of all of the programs and projects that I've created so far!

2. My favorite assignment was Assignment 2- Landmarks. It was exciting for me 
to synchronize newfound knowledge of the Google Maps API, JSON data, and asynchronous requests,
and to get a visibly working website out of it. It was also my first experience making 
a larger and more complex website. It's amazing to know that I created something that will render my current
location and nearest landmarks wherever I go! 

3. I have grown a ton from day 1 to now. I barely understood how the Internet worked beforehand, but
now I can create and render web pages and style sheets, create web servers, and use revision control.
I have learned about security, bootstrap, MongoDB, and various APIs- I have 
truly come a long way from day 1! I'm excited to put all of this knowledge to use as I take 
more classes and work on personal projects.

4. The most important thing I learned was how to both create my own content and integrate pre-written content.
ex) Landmarks,  integration of Google Maps API with my own code
ex) Group project, use of Google Places API and bootstrap with my own code to create overall program

5. Now that I'm done with the course, I would like to delve deeper into a couple of topics. I'm interested 
in mobile development, so I'll be taking that class next semester! I also want to better understand 
bootstrap and to keep expanding my knowledge of front-end programming.
